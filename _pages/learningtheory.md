# ***General information:***

Welcome to theLearning Theory Reading Group at Scool, Inria Lille.

- *Who:* Everyone is welcome.

- *When:* Every Wednesday, 2:00-3:00 UTC +2 (subject to micro-adjustments which will be displayed if any), (If you want to attend, but the time does not suit you, please let me know)

- *Where:* Batiment A, Salle A00.

- *Assumed Background:* Basics in Reinforcement Learning, Basics in Learning Theory and Information Theory.

- *Operation mode:* Discussing papers. Some papers may go out of the scope of RL and we may include topics in a much broader sense.
