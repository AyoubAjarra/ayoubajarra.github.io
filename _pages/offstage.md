This is my little corner where I share some notes and my passion for guitar. I’m a big fan of Khruangbin, Bthlvs, and Glass Beams, the kind of sound that casts a spell without you noticing, so most of what you’ll hear is my humble take of their covers, along with a few original pieces influenced by their groove driven style.
