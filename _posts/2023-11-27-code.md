In this blog, we'll share highlghts of Comete workshop that held at Inria Saclay in Paris. The talks were very interesting going from philosophical aspect of AI ethics from a high level perspective to problem specific connecting fairness and differential privacy. 
# AI between legal regulation morality and evidence loops:
Ljupcho Grozdanovski's talk was about distinguishing between knowledge/discovery and belief for algorithms in law decision making; Discovery is fact based knowledge of causation, belief can often be biased. Explainability induces evidence aligned with discovery definition to prevent the harm that could be potentially caused by the AI system. However, even explanations are conditionned pn social and cultural background, which rises the following question: can we come up with universal explanations?
# Differential privacy impact on Fairness:
Test
# Fairness auditors
