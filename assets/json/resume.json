      "summary": " Studied the ability of ML models to predict space time evolution of a dynamical system (fluids) with almost no knowledge of a physicist. Developped a new approach based on Helmholtz theorem to reduce the representation -describing Rayleigh-Bénard instability, into a discrete one and study the interaction of the vortices represented by keypoints, then implemented a graph encoder-decoder to learn the space-time evolution of the discrete representation based on causal graphs.",
